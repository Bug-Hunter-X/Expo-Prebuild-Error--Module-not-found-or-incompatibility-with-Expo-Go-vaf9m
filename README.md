# Expo Prebuild Error: Module not found or incompatibility with Expo Go

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using Expo's `expo prebuild` command. The error arises from a mismatch between project dependencies and the Expo Go app's capabilities, often involving native modules.

## Problem

The `expo prebuild` process fails due to an unresolved module or incompatibility with the Expo Go environment. This is usually indicated by an error message highlighting a missing module or a version conflict.  This issue typically arises when using native modules not supported by Expo Go or when dependency versions are incorrect.

## Solution

The solution involves reviewing the project's dependencies and ensuring compatibility with Expo Go. This might include:

* **Removing unsupported native modules:**  If possible, replace native modules with Expo-compatible alternatives.
* **Checking dependency versions:** Update or downgrade dependencies as needed to resolve version conflicts.  Refer to the documentation of the problematic modules for compatibility information.
* **Using EAS Build:** Consider using Expo's EAS Build instead of `expo prebuild` for building and deploying your app.  EAS Build provides better compatibility and more flexibility.
* **Reviewing Expo Go limitations:** Be aware of the limitations of Expo Go; it doesn't support all native modules.

This example showcases a potential scenario and its resolution.
