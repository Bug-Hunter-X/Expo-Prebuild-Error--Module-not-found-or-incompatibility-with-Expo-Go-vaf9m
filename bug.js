This error typically occurs when using Expo's `expo prebuild` command and involves a mismatch between the project's dependencies and the Expo Go app's capabilities.  It might manifest as an error message indicating a missing module or an incompatibility between native modules and the Expo Go environment. For instance, you might encounter this if you're using a native module that's not supported by Expo Go or if a dependency has an incorrect version. The actual error message may vary, but it usually points to a problem during the prebuild process where Expo tries to prepare your project for running on a device or simulator.
